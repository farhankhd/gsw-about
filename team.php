                    graduate, having studied Computer Science and Architecture. She is a strong proponent of
                    interdisciplinary approaches to complex programs. Her belief is that good product design requires
                    attention to three core values – empathy, innovation and elegance. In developing startups and large
                    corporations, attention to these details and their broader systemic impacts is key. She's excited to
