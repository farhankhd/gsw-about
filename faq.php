                        <strong>Is it a sit-down lunch or buffet?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It's a lunch box, but there will be space to sit-down.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Where is the meeting point if I'm coming in a big group?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>We suggest the registration area on the 22nd floor.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Can I get the slides from speakers?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Some speakers will share their slides, but others wish to keep their slides private. Those who share will announce links from which you can download.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How can I get in-touch with a speaker after the event?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Most speakers will provide a contact email. If you wish to contact a particular speaker who does not provide an email, we will endeavour to facilitate this.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>When do you plan to have another event like this?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>MIT GSW is an annual event, held in a different country each year. This event has never been held in Thailand before, and is unlikely to be held again in Thailand for several years.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>How should I dress?</strong>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The dress code is <strong>smart casual</strong>. Bear in mind that some parts of the venue may be quite cool.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
